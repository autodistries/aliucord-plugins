# TimestampUtilities
Adds a simple /timestamp command which converts the timestamp you give to a date and a relative date.

Todo:
    - settings to choose what date form to show
    - User lookup by id
    - This  "It could also be helpful to have a list of IDs to look for, and if one is found, it gets highlighted in a colour of your choosing, wether that be a user in the member list, channel in a server, or just text in a channel." when i have  some more experience
